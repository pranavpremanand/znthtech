    Why Indian healthcare providers must prioritize cybersecurity in the age of digital health records and remote care?
  </h1>

  <!-- Intro Paragraphs -->
  <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
    The healthcare industry is undergoing a powerful digital transformation. From telemedicine to digital prescriptions and connected medical devices, healthcare is becoming increasingly data-driven. While this revolution improves efficiency and patient care, it also opens up a dangerous frontier: cybersecurity threats.
  </p>
  <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-8">
    At ZnthTech, we work at the intersection of technology and healthcare, and we're seeing firsthand how critical cybersecurity has become in this space. This blog is a call to action for healthcare professionals to understand and address these rising risks.

  <!-- Digital Health Boom Section -->
  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 dark:text-white mb-4">The Digital Health Boom — And the Risks</h2>
  <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
    Electronic Health Records (EHRs), wearable health devices, online consultations, and remote monitoring are now integral to modern healthcare. However, with this increased connectivity comes vulnerability. Cybercriminals are targeting healthcare systems more than ever, exploiting gaps in security for financial gain or data theft.
  </p>
  <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">Some of the most common cybersecurity threats in healthcare include:</p>
  <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
    <li><span class="font-semibold">Ransomware attacks:</span> Encrypting hospital data and demanding payment.</li>
    <li><span class="font-semibold">Phishing:</span> Tricking staff into revealing credentials.</li>
    <li><span class="font-semibold">Insider threats:</span> Misuse of access by employees.</li>
    <li><span class="font-semibold">Data breaches:</span> Unauthorized access to sensitive patient data.</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">The consequences are not just technical — they're deeply human:</p>
  <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
    <li><span class="font-semibold">Patient privacy violations:</span> Leaked medical records can cause emotional and reputational harm.</li>
    <li><span class="font-semibold">Disrupted care:</span> Cyberattacks can shut down systems, delaying treatments.</li>
    <li><span class="font-semibold">Financial impact:</span> From ransom payments to regulatory fines and lawsuits.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="italic text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
    A notable case was the 2017 WannaCry ransomware attack that crippled the UK's National Health Service, delaying surgeries and locking out critical data.

  <!-- Prime Target Section -->
  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 dark:text-white mb-4">Why Is Healthcare a Prime Target?</h2>
  <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
    Healthcare data is one of the most valuable assets on the dark web. It contains personal, financial, and medical information that can be used for identity theft, insurance fraud, and more.
  </p>
  <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
    Unfortunately, many healthcare providers still rely on outdated software and hardware. Combined with busy staff who may not be trained in cybersecurity best practices, this creates an environment ripe for exploitation.
